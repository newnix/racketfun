## Fun With Racket
This is a repository to track learning and playing with Racket.
Any code outside of the `/intro` directory is at this time considered my own, and will 
therefore be made available under the same terms as any other Exile Heavy Industries code.
At this time, the `/intro` directory is just following along with the racket introductory
manual, helping to solidify the learning process for the language.
